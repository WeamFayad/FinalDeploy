<!-- UI UX -->
<img src="./readme/title4.svg"/>

> The design process for Paws began with meticulous planning, utilizing Excalidraw for initial structuring of the project. This foundational step ensured a cohesive and well-organized structure. Subsequently, the project transitioned to Figma, where detailed wireframes and sophisticated mockups were meticulously crafted, laying the groundwork for a visually compelling and user-friendly design.

### Mockups

  <br><br>

<!-- Database Design -->
<img src="./readme/title5.svg"/>

### Database Design:

Paws is uniquely structured with a dual-database architecture to cater to the diverse needs of the platform. The project intelligently integrates two types of databases: MongoDB and MySQL, ensuring a robust and versatile data management system.

MongoDB: I employ MongoDB, a powerful NoSQL database, for my web platforms. This choice allows us to handle complex data structures with ease, providing high performance, high availability, and easy scalability. The flexible schema of MongoDB is perfectly suited for my web applications, allowing for rapid development and the ability to handle large volumes of unstructured data. Below is the ER diagram:

<img src="./readme/database/mongo.png" alt="ER Diagram / MongoDB" width="600" height="600"/>

MySQL: For my mobile app platform, I rely on MySQL, a renowned open-source relational database management system. MySQL stands out for its reliability and is widely recognized for its performance and strong data protection features. By using MySQL for my mobile platform, I ensure that data is structured, consistent, and securely managed. Below is the ER diagram:

<img src="./readme/database/MySQL.png" alt="ER Diagram / MySQL" width="600" height="600"/>

Together, these databases form the backbone of Paws, supporting my mission to deliver a seamless and efficient experience across both web and mobile platforms. Whether it's handling dynamic content on the web or ensuring data integrity in mobile applications, my dual-database architecture is designed to meet the diverse and evolving needs of my users.

### Machine Learning (Breed Classification)

My machine learning model stands at the core of the Paws Project, adeptly categorizing 37 breeds of dogs and cats using a dataset specifically crafted for this purpose. It's a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) employing transfer learning, with DenseNet121 as the base, finely tuned for my classification task. The model, trained through supervised learning on a labeled dataset, undergoes rigorous training and validation, incorporating data augmentation to enhance its robustness. It distinguishes itself by accurately predicting pet breeds, pivotal for identifying lost pets or reporting found ones on the web platform, and recognizing user pet breeds in the mobile app. This model is not just a component; it's the intelligence that powers the Paws Project.

- For more detailed information and a deeper dive into the model, its architecture, and its functionalities, please refer to: [Paws Machine Learning Process](./machine-learning/README.md).

### Arduino (Live Tracker)

The Arduino-based pet tracker plays a pivotal role, as it employs an ESP8266 chip for WiFi connectivity and a Neo-6M-GPS module to fetch real-time location data. By interfacing these modules on a breadboard and programming them through Arduino IDE, we've crafted a seamless tracker. The system periodically transmits the pet's coordinates to my backend, ensuring each pet's location is meticulously logged in the "trackers" table of my database.  
For a more comprehensive understanding of the Arduino process and the code's intricacies, please refer to the detailed documentation: [Paws Live Tracker](./arduino/README.md).

<!-- Prompt Engineering -->
<img src="./readme/title7.svg"/>

### Prompt Engineering:

In this project, I harness the power of advanced prompt engineering to fine-tune the interactions with my natural language processing model, particularly within the Chat screen. Prompt engineering is not just about sending requests to the AI; it's an art and science that involves crafting well-structured and contextually rich input instructions to guide the model's responses more effectively and predictably.

"You are an AI Doctor working for the Paws application to answer questions only related to pets and animals."

This prompts is then sent to OpenAI's GPT model, ensuring that the AI's responses are not only relevant and informative but also adhere to the predefined role and context of the conversation.

Key aspects of my prompt engineering approach include:

1- Contextual Relevance: Ensuring that the prompt includes enough context from the conversation history to make the responses coherent and contextually appropriate.

2- Role Specification: Clearly defining the AI's character (role: AI Doctor) at the beginning of the conversation to guide its tone, style, and scope of responses.

3- Dynamic Interaction: Continuously updating the prompt with new messages, allowing the AI to maintain a natural and engaging conversation flow.

4- Precision and Efficiency: Carefully structuring prompts to elicit specific types of responses, enabling the AI to handle a variety of tasks effectively, from answering user inquiries to providing advice on pet care.

By leveraging these techniques, my Chat screen offers users a sophisticated and intuitive conversational experience, making their interactions with the AI not just a dialogue but a journey of discovery and assistance. Whether it's addressing pet health concerns or offering insights into animal behavior, my prompt engineering ensures that every response is a step towards a more informed and engaged user.

  <img src="./readme/aws/packages.jpg" width="600" height="600"/>

<br><br>

<!-- Unit Testing -->
<img src="./readme/title9.svg"/>

### Unit Testing:

Throughout the development of Paws, The testing strategy was structured to incorporate thorough input validation and extensive API testing through Postman. This method offered immediate insights into the functionality and reliability of our endpoints. Further enhancing the robustness of our application, I integrated a deeper, automated layer of validation with comprehensive unit testing. This blend of manual and automated testing procedures fortified the foundation of Paws, ensuring the system's integrity and reliability of the tested endpoints.
